I am a 10th grade student from Edison, New Jersey, and I wanted to see if you had any t-shirts or paraphernalia available so I could represent your school! I am interested in majoring in computer science, with a minor in business and I am very interested in your school; I feel like I would definitely shine there. If you have any t-shirts size Adult-Small, pennants, or such I would appreciate it greatly! My address is: 1601 Deerfield Drive, Edison New Jersey, 08820. Please email me back if you would like to confirm your clothing delivery. Thank you so much! Sincerely, Samarth Parekh"
