context = ssl.create_default_context()

# Email Construction
message = MIMEMultipart("alternative")
message["Subject"] = "School Clothing"
message["From"] = sender_email

# Mass Distribution Loop
with smtplib.SMTP_SSL(smtp_server, port, context=context) as server:
    server.login(sender_email, password)
    with open("emails.csv") as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
