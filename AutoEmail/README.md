I coded this project to be able to receive free merch from all American schools, private and public. I utilized the Single Mail Transfer Protocol and its respective Python library to mass send emails inquiring about the possibility of free merch. The success was incredible as I received lots of materials and merch, which kickstarted my college search, and I learned a new skill as well.
