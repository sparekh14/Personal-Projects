I utilized the MERN stack to develop this project. The details of how I used each component are listed below.

M - MongoDB: I used a MongoDB database to store each transaction. I defined a schema in my code through which I created a model, or a collection in my Mongo database. I interacted with my Mongo database collection through this defined model.

E - Express.js: I used Express.js to create an Express application which allowed me to develop my API (specifically GET and POST requests), allow CORS, and convert JSON payloads into JavaScript objects. Express.js allowed me to handle requests and responses between my frontend and backend.

R - React.js: This was the core of my frontend. I utilized React.js to develop the UI/UX of my webapp by integrating in HTML/CSS as well as state-based properties, allowing the user to enter their transaction information into the form components as well as view them all in a neat, mannered, format

N - Node.js: This helped me in running the server side code and the Express application.

Beyond this, I utilized Yarn to initiate my webapp as well as the Node Package Manager (npm) in order to install and manage dependencies I needed for my project.
